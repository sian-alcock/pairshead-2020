This project has been built as part of a learning module in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Course using JavaScript, Python, Django and React.

It has been solely developed by Sian Alcock.

### Project duration
7 days.

### Installation
* Clone or download the repo
* yarn and pipenv install to install dependencies
* ?? do we need to create a database???
* yarn serve:backend to run backend
* yarn serve:frontednd to run front-end

## Brief

The project brief is as follows:

* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use a Python Django API** using Django REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. **ALLOW** time for this.
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.
* **Have automated tests** for _at least_ one RESTful resource on the back-end. Improve your employability by demonstrating a good understanding of testing principals.
